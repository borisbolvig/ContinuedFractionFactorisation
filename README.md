## Navigating Terminal

To use Terminal you will two basic commands for navigating.
In the Terminal you are always in some directory. Every directory has an address like /home/boris/documents/.
To see your current working directory, type in `pwd` and hit Enter.

To change directory type `cd` followed by a whitespace and the full or relative path to the new directory.

```Boriss-MacBook-Pro:~ Boris$ pwd
/Users/Boris
Boriss-MacBook-Pro:~ Boris$ cd Documents
Boriss-MacBook-Pro:Documents Boris$ pwd
/Users/Boris/Documents```

Another useful command is `ls`. This *lists* the files and subdirectories of the current work directory. 

Run 
```which python```

If you get something that is not an error message, you should be able to run the code.

Any .py file can be run by
```python anypyfile.py```
